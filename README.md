# Portfolio

maybe flexbox for list of skills, or roles. volunteering, software dev, maintenance
or maybe roll the small social media icons into portfolio and contact
a bit more gap between social links would be good

could be light and dark mode like in https://www.paytonpierce.dev/
is the pdf icon responsive for odnwloading resume?
