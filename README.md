## Notes

maybe flexbox for list of skills, or roles. volunteering, software dev, maintenance
or maybe roll the small social media icons into portfolio and contact
a bit more gap between social links would be good

could be light and dark mode like in https://www.paytonpierce.dev/
is the pdf icon responsive for odnwloading resume? it is also too orange

maybe skills like in https://github.com/aycanogut/aycan.dev also has lightdark mode

detailed description of skills in about and also a skills page?

https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio codewithsadee left right scrolling? skills for categories all/ cat1 cat2 etc

show contacts when narrow screen means not enough gap between avatar and links

better sample resume

later on, make social media like linkedin and github more obvious, with descriptions and less gray icons

 less wasted space https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7516005/how-to-make-a-bullet-list-align-with-text-in-css
