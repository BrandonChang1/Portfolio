# Portfolio

maybe flexbox for list of skills, or roles. volunteering, software dev, maintenance
or maybe roll the small social media icons into portfolio and contact
a bit more gap between social links would be good

could be light and dark mode like in https://www.paytonpierce.dev/
is the pdf icon responsive for odnwloading resume? it is also too orange

add correct linkedin link

show contacts when narrow screen means not enough gap between avatar and links

better sample resume

later on, make social media like linkedin and github more obvious, with descriptions and less gray icons
