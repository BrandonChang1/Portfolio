CPSC 349, Fall 2024

## Usage

Download the project by clicking on the Green "Code" button, then click "Download ZIP", or clone the repository using Git or Github tools. Extract the files if they are compressed. Open the "index.html" file in a modern web browser. 

## Notes

maybe flexbox for list of skills, or roles. volunteering, software dev, maintenance
or maybe roll the small social media icons into portfolio and contact
a bit more gap between social links would be good

could be light and dark mode like in https://www.paytonpierce.dev/
is the pdf icon responsive for odnwloading resume? it is also too orange

add correct linkedin link www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-c-398642341

why should i have detailed description of skills in about when i need a skills page? redundant?

show contacts when narrow screen means not enough gap between avatar and links

better sample resume

later on, make social media like linkedin and github more obvious, with descriptions and less gray icons

            less wasted space https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7516005/how-to-make-a-bullet-list-align-with-text-in-css<br>
